		<div id="artistdossier"><h1>EDWIN CRUZ IS AN <br> INDEPENDENT MURALIST, DESIGNER, AND <br> ILLUSTRATOR BASED IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA. Cruz pushes to insert himself into the contemporary world of painting by joining the long line of Latino muralist in the DMV area including Mas Paz, Rodrigo Pradel, Mike Pacheco, James Wilson and Guache. Cruzâ€™s work reflects his multi-cultural background rooted in the immigration of his Salvadoran parents, growing up with hip-hop and East Coast graffiti influences. One of his earliest memories in the arts was his father using a napkin and a pen during dinner to illustrate a horse from memory. Cruz merges biographical storytelling, his faith in Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior with tools and methods of graffiti and street art. Typical themes include: dynamic fashion/music subcultures, nature-based architectural design, street photography, influential sport figures, Biblical parables and Salvadoran traditions. When not applying masonry paint to walls, Cruz focuses on entering the world of augmented reality (AR) development.</h1></div>
