	<h1>Critiquing Portfolios</h1>
	<p>These are the portfolios that have stood out to me and have given me inspiration for my own portfolio. Some are independent artists and some are studios with icons in graphic design.</p>
	
<h2>Melanie Daveid<br><br>
	<a href="http://melaniedaveid.com/"><img src="images/melanie.png" alt="melanie daveids portfolio"></a></h2>

	<p>Daveid's portfolio stood out to me ever since we started working on project 2. The color theme of her portfolio is very energetic and matches the movement of her hand logo at the bottom of the page (which I'm guessing she used anchors for). The top of the page is simple and clean which makes it easy for the visitor to maneuver around. Scrolling down the page, you notice that the left side (category) stays anchored until the end of the content on the right side. I think that was a very good idea and it works well since you can fill up the width of the page pretty nicely.</p>

<h2>Kareem Sabri<br><br>

	<p>When you have a great photo, you can't go wrong with making it the hero photo of the site. Kareem chose a well contrasted and lit photo of him at wor with his tools. The logo is well done and gives it a feel of professionalism. Usually logos are circular or in a rectangle shape so it really gives contrast just like the hamburger menu. You see the diamond shape from the logo extend to the back-to-top button which adds a nice touch of consisteny throughout the site. Sabri takes really nice photos and he showcases his art well with no borders for the content. It transitions well to the white background. Finally, he ends it on a smaller picture of himself at work with the same consistency of the hero image.</p>

<h2>Ben Kirchner<br><br>
	<a href="http://benkirchner.co.uk/"><img src="images/ben.png" alt="Ben Kirchner's Portfolio"></a></h2>

	<p>The white background was an excellent choice by Kirchner, as the visitor gets to see his colorfully soothing illustrations pop right off the page. His work is divided by the client he has worked with so it is pretty easy to navigate around the site. The nav bar has small font but they have a lot of characters and the curning makes them easy to read for me but not sure for the 65+ age group. The layout to his mobile site is consistent with his desktop version just that the nav bar items are hidden under a menu button. Overall, really clean and simple. The margins are not too small and not to big, just enough to make the work look unified.</p>

<h2>Pentagram Studio<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.pentagram.com/"><img src="images/pentagram.png" alt="Pentagram's website"></a></h2>

	<p>I added studio websites on here because they are very similar to an individual's portfolio. A studio's work is generally handled by a team so it is more detailed oriented and also the studio statement is tweaked to the clients they design for. With that being said, Pentagram is a studio run by the iconic Paula Scher and their work shows why they are the best in the world. Comparing it to Kirchner's content size, Pentagram lowers the height to make the content look wider. They do have their name in red on the top left corner just like Kirchner's portfolio. The detail that I love the most is once you select a type of client, you then select the top work. The next page,on the bottom, they give you a preview of the next content by showcasing it in a really small vertical height. Another treat is the about page. The background color changes from white to black in order to give a more personal look to the team of designer's black and white headshot photo. When you have a chance, look at the contact page and see if you notice the time. </p>

<h2>Blind Studio<br><br>
	<a href="https://blind.com/"><img src="images/blind.png" alt="Blind Studio's Website"></a></h2>

	<p>Another studio that I have so much respect for is Blind Studio located out of Santa Monica, California. Their work speaks to how versatile the studio is. On their home page, you get a slideshow of a wide range of specialties that include motion graphics. For the video game fans, Master Chief's front profile staring at you intrigues the visitor even more. The heirarchy of text on top of the hero image is intriguing because the welcome text is smaller than the studio statement. I believe it works really well because the visitor (possible client) gets a good impression of the studio's goal for their client. Another design detail that I like is the tall footer which makes it look like a business card. Hmmm... definitely going to steal that idea. </p>
