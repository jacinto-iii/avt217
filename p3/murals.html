			<h3>NoMa MURAL</h3>
			<h4>Commissioned by RD Jones</h4>
			<p>"From a place of pure creativity, a young woman blows bubbles into the unknown. Helping introduce new ideas, technology, and a way of seeing" - Artists statement

<br><br>This mural is located in NoMA DC inside an apartment building. A fellow artist and I were commissioned by an interior design + architecture company to paint a mural inside the E-Lounge (electronic lounge). With multiple renderings and careful coordination with the client, we created a design that is very well suited for tenants to come to the E-Lounge and feel a sense of inspiration. What makes this mural stand out is the stylistic lines used to make it a unique work of art as well as the use spray paint to bring an eye popping effect.</p>
