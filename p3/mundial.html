			<h3>WORLD CUP 2018: BRAZIL HYPE VIDEO</h3>
			<h4>New Media Project</h4>
			<p>This idea came into existence because of the entertainment that Brazilian soccer brings and 2018 feels special. With players like Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Marcelo and Coutinho bringing you the footwork that Brazil is known for, it was only right to make something that captures my excitement for what this team has in store for the World Cup.

<br><br>I specifically used Neymar as a centerpiece for this video, not only because he is one of the biggest names in soccer but because the way he just makes defenders look RIDICULOUS. The video clip plays on a digital painting of mines which includes a retro TV with dials, a beer and pupusas on a typical plate you would see in a Salvadoran restaurant.

<br><br>Quick note on the music I chose. MC Bin Laden is from Sao Paolo and he has an impactful voice in Brazilian music in which he uses to represent people of his hometown. The same people who are forgotten about during the corruption and crisis going on in Brazil today. To me, that translates to what Brazilian soccer players do on the pitch every time they play.

<br><br>Thank you and I hope you enjoy the video.</p>
