	<h1>Critiquing the websites of top DC Restaurants</h1>
	<p>Washingtonian magazine rates the top restaurants in the area every year. Now I want to critique them on their websites</p>
	
<h2>Bad Saint<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.badsaintdc.com/"><img src="badsaint.png" alt=“Bad Saint website”></a></h2>

	<p>The rich colors lock you in with a quickness as the site makes very little request to the server. The hero on the home page gives you a sneak peek of the ambience curated to show that their restaurant is modern, higher-end Filipino cuisine. The navigation bar consist of clear wording. You continue to experience the personality of the restaurant in one of the menus that highlight the staff. Overall, it is very simple and clear with subtle hints to show it’s a modern restaurant. </p>

<h2>Pineapple and Pearls<br><br
	<a href="http://pineappleandpearls.com/"><img src="pandp.png" alt=“Pineapple and Pearls website"></a></h2>

	<p>The elegance really pops off the page with high res hero photographs of the food placed on white and black marble. Before getting to dive into the flesh of the webpage, you are stopped by an alert pop-up that informs the visitor that they have a reduced price of $225 for their 9-course tasting menu. The menu bar is subtly placed on the top right corner with the reservation link purposefully out of it. You can easily find out more about the restaurant through their info page and stories page. The footers have the necessary means to contact the restaurant with a link to their best social media account. Overall, they cater to their audience and are pretty informative as to pricing and what constitutes such a high bill!   </p>

<h2>The Dabney<br><br>
	<a href="https://thedabney.com/"><img src="dabney.png" alt=“The Dabney website"></a></h2>

	<p>The Dabney does not disappoint with a website that delivers almost all the content on the homepage. The beauty is the behavior of the website that delivers movable great quality photos to go with the descriptions. The typography goes with the rustic feel to the website that also includes graphite drawings of vegetable plants. While the website might deliver too much information on the homepage compared to the other sites, I still think it works. Too split the content into a more drawn out navigation menu will make the site look really clean and simple in which will allow the visitor to really fall in love with the design and content. </p>

<h2>Old Ebbitt Grill<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.ebbitt.com/"><img src="ebbitt.png" alt="Ebbitt website"></a></h2>

	<p>Old Ebbitt goes back to the gallery of hero images as the focus point of the home page. You get three that rotate every 3 Mississippis. One thing that I found on Ebbitt’s website that differs from others, is it that it was created by third-party web design company called, Bentobox. They specialize in creating websites for restaurants and they made a simple webpage that accurately depicts the feel of the restaurant chain. The navigation drop down menu offers 12 options that gives you all the necessary information to know what the restaurant offers. Most importantly, the contact info is on the header of the webpage instead at the footer that contains other franchises under the restaurant company.</p>

<h2>Taqueria Habanero<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.habanerodc.com/"><img src="habanero.png" alt=“Taqueria Habanero website”></a></h2>

	<p>Taqueria Habanero is a go-to spot for authentic Mexican cuisine with a speciality in tacos. The website does not do the restaurant justice. The static images on the webpages are minimized and look to not be on a grid. The information is all there and the navigation bar is pretty clear but the overall feel of the website is not clear. The color-scheme is very elementary and make for more confusion as to where your eye is supposed to look. Hierarchy is needed. The highlight to the website is the Facebook feed found on the homepage that give you a more accurate look of the restaurant and provides a genuine look of the staff.Overall, the HTML and CSS needs an upgrade to compete with these other restaurants. </p>
